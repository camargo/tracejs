- Review:
    1. What is Software Engineering (SE)?
        - NOT Computer Science
            - Science goal: Expand general knowledge.
            - Engineering goal: Solve problems.
        - NOT Programming
            - SE includes teams, scale, complexity, liability, etc...
        - Difference to other engineering disciplines
            - Software (SW) no production line. Almost all cost in SW is in development and upgrades.

- BUSINESS ORG / SW ORG Chart
    - Think JPL example

- SCRUM: "Lightweight" SW Process
    - Small Teams
    - Incremental Development
        - Tight feedback loop
    - Time-boxed Scheduling
    - Adaptive and agile

- The Agile Manifesto
    - http://agilemanifesto.org/

- SCRUM Process Overview (Single Sprint)
    - See Graphic
    - Role defined and action you want to take (features the customer needs) => Add to Backlog
    - During sprint, select a subset of the Backlog
    - Break subset into tasks => Add to sprint Backlog
        - You CANNOT change sprint tasks once you are in a sprint!!!
    - Do as many tasks as possible
    - Daily SCRUM, Weekly SCRUM, Monthly SCRUM meeting
    - Output a potentially shippable product increment

- Release
    - Accomplished in multiple sprints
    - In this class we will have 3 sprints

- Sprints
    - Time-boxed! Ends when time is up, not when sprint goal reached
    - See slide for more information

- Process Linearization in Time
    - Waterfall Method: Requirements, Design, Code, Test
    - In contrast: Rather than doing all of the one thing at a time (see Waterfall Method) - SCRUM teams do a little of everything all the time.

- SCRUM Framework
    - Roles
        - Product Owner: Chairman of product
            - Defines product features
            - Decides on release date and content
            - Business and marketing. ROI.
            - Adjust features between sprints (i.e. every increment).
        - SCRUM Master: Keep the team functioning smoothly. Make sure SCRUM practices are working.
            - Main point of contact to larger organization
        - Team
            - Cross-functional (Programmers, testers, UI, etc...)
            - Full-time
            - Self-organizing
                - Team members decide themselves what they want to work on
            - Membership change only between sprints
    - Ceremonies
        - Release planning
            - Major milestone of SW project
            - Contains a set of product features
            - Specified by user stories (initially listed in backlog)
            - Release Planning: Goal: Determine the set of user stories to include
                1. Analyze project concept and decompose a set of user stories
                2. Prioritize user stories
                3. Estimate in story points time required to implement feature specified by each user story
            - Release Plan:
                - Result of Release Planning
                - Input into sprint planning process
        - Sprint planning
        - Sprint review
        - Daily SCRUM meeting
    - Artifacts (What are we producing?)
        - Product backlog
        - Sprint backlog
        - Burndown charts

- Assignment
    - SCRUM videos (See slide)
