- Planning for the SCRUMs
    - As part of your Sprint planning
        - Each groups needs to establish a min of 3 Scrum meetings during each week (15 minute time-boxed and stand-up)
            - List these times on a corner of your Scrum board in your lab
        - This is a face-to-face, stand-up meeting - physical presence is important
        - Your TA needs to be present for at lease one of these three SCRUMS
        - Schedule a time for a Scrum meeting with your TA
            - Location: Lab
        - Professor may visit during any team's Scrum meeting
